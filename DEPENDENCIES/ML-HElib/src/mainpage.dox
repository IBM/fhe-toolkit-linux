/**
@mainpage ML-HElib Documentation (Beta version)

Simplified ML library using HElib. API is subject to rapid change.

This API is designed to provide high level access to homomorphic encryption tools,
especially for AI related applications.

In particular it currently offers the following:

- High level wrappers for HE initialization and I/O.
- Simple tools to support neural network I/O and inference for a specific architecture:
  3 fully connected layers. 

Here are some top level classes, refer to their documentation for more information:

HelibCkksContext 
HelibConfig
