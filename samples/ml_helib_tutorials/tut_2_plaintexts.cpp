  // we now want to multiply each slot by 4.
  // one way to do it is to encrypt the vector (4,4,4,0,0,0....) to c2
  // and exeucte c1.multiply(c2),
  // but ciphertext-ciphertext multiplication is expensive
  // There are three things that might make our operation cheaper:
  //   - we want to multiply by a known (non-encrypted) value of 4.
  //   - 4 is an integer
  //   - 4 is a scalar, i.e., all slots are multiplied by the same value.
  // So here's how it's done:
  CTile c2(c1); // we copy c1 to c2 to keep the original for more examples
  c2.multiplyScalar(4);
  // this operation is both time efficient and consumes minimal resources
  // inside the ciphertext.
  // Let's verify it worked:

  // say we want to multiply our c1 encrypted vector with a non-encrypted vector
  // (4,5,6,...)
  vector<double> clearVals{4, 5, 6};
  // to multiply each slot by a different plaintext number, a slightly more
  // expensive
  // operation is required, but still cheaper than ciphertext-ciphertext
  // multiplication
  // First we create PTile, an encoded, but not-encrypted form of our vector
  PTile p(he);
  encoder.encode(p, clearVals);

  // now we multiply c2 by p using multiplyPlain:
  c2 = c1;
  c2.multiplyPlain(p);
  encoder.assertEquals(c2, "multiplyPlain", vector<double>{4, 10, 18});
  c2.debugPrint("after multiplyPlain");

  // add and sub for plaintexts also supported:
  c2 = c1;
  c2.addPlain(p);
  encoder.assertEquals(c2, "addPlain", vector<double>{5, 7, 9});

  c2 = c1;
  c2.subPlain(p);
