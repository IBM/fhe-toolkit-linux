${bold}Usage: $scriptname [options] CONTAINER_IMG${normal}

${bold}CONTAINER_IMG${normal}     Selects the name of toolkit container image to render the documentation from.
                  This should be the IBMCOM pre-built toolkit from Docker Hub 
                  or the locally built toolkit tagged container name. This script
                  expects this container image name to exist in the local docker image catalog.
                  Supported container OS are:
                  x86_64/amd64: {ubuntu, fedora, centos, alpine}
                  s390x:        {ubuntu}

${bold}Options:${normal}
-h                Displays this help information.

${bold}Example:${normal}

To render documentation from a local toolkit build:
WriteMLHElibAPIDocs.sh local/fhe-toolkit-ubuntu

To render documentation from a fetched toolkit build:
WriteMLHElibAPIDocs.sh ibmcom/fhe-toolkit-fedora
